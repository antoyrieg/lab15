  <p> Once upon a time in {{showStory.place1}}, there lived a mighty sad {{showStory.animal}}. His name was {{showStory.name1}} and he loved to eat
  {{showStory.food}} in his favorite chill spot, which was {{showStory.place2}}. One day, he was on his way to {{showStory.place2}} with his
  {{showStory.food}} when he spotted a big bag of {{showStory.thing}}. He was so happy to find the bag of {{showStory.thing}}, that he dropped his
  {{showStory.food}} and ran away real, real fast, not even thinking about his chill spot anymore. {{showStory.name1}} ran right to his bestfriend,
   {{showStory.name2}}'s house, to show him what he found. {{showStory.name2}} took the {{showStory.thing}} and ran far away, leaving
   {{showStory.name1}} mighty sad once again. </p>
